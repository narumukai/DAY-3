Difference Between Window,Screen and Document in javascript


Window:
The JavaScript window object sits at the top of the JavaScript Object hierarchy and represents the browser window. The window object is supported by all browsers. All global JavaScript objects , functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object. The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser . This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.

Window Properties:
1.window.innerHeight
2.window.innerWidth


Document:

The Document object represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web pageâ€™s content, which is the DOM tree. When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object. It is the root node of the HTML document. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.


document object methods:
document.getElementById(id) 
document.getElementsByTagName(name)
document.getElementsByClassName(name) 


Changing HTML elements:

element.innerHTML = new html content 
element.attribute = new value 
element.style.property = new style

Adding and Deleting HTML elements:
1.document.createElement(element) 
2.document.removeChild(element)
3.document.appendChild(element) 
4.document.replaceChild(new, old)
5.document.write(text)
